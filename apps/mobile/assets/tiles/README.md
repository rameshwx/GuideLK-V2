# Offline tiles placeholder

Place the `sri_lanka.mbtiles` dataset generated from a licensed provider (e.g. OpenMapTiles)
in this directory. The application copies the file to the device documents directory the first
time it runs and serves map tiles from there. The MBTiles archive must contain standard
`xyz` formatted raster tiles.
